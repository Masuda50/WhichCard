<h1 class="display-4">About Us</h1>

<p class="font-weight-normal">Our goal at Which Card is to develop a tool that will allow users to easily compare different rewards credit cards 
    ased on how they shop. Allow even a novice credit card user to get a card that will allow him or her to earn the most points, 
    miles or cash back possble.</p>
    
<h5 style="color:#337CFF">Our Product</h5>
<p class="font-weight-normal">We’ll develop a credit card comparison tool that accounts for peoples’ spending habits, and instantly ranks 
    credit card options from America’s top 6 banks - from most to least rewarding. The tool will also display to users their first year 
    rewards value estimate, and provide a few details about each card so they can quickly compare cards side-by-side.
    
    <p class="font-weight-normal"></p>We can collect information on credit cards from here: https://www.creditcards.com/rewards-cards/</p>
    
    <p class="font-weight-normal"> We can collect the value of points/miles here: https://thepointsguy.com/guide/monthly-valuations/</p>
    
    <p class="font-weight-normal">Cash back is easy, because that’s just straight money (example 1% cash back on $100 is just $1)</p>
