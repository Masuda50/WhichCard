<h1>About Us</h1>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<h4>To develop a tool that will allow users to easily compare different rewards credit cards based on how they shop. Allow even a novice credit card user to get a card that will allow him or her to earn the most points, miles or cash back they can.</h4>
    
<h2>Product</h2>

    <h4>We’ll develop a credit card comparison tool that accounts for peoples’ spending habits, and instantly ranks credit card options from America’s top 6 banks - from most to least rewarding. The tool will also display to users their first year rewards value estimate, and provide a few details about each card so they can quickly compare cards side-by-side.
    
        We can collect information on credit cards from here: https://www.creditcards.com/rewards-cards/
        
        We can collect the value of points/miles here: https://thepointsguy.com/guide/monthly-valuations/
        
        Cash back is easy, because that’s just straight money (example 1% cash back on $100 is just $1)</h4>
