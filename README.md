# Problem statement

Today, over 70% of households in the United States have at least 1 credit card. Almost 1 in 4 millennials plans to open a new credit card account in the next year, a higher percentage than both Gen Xers (23%) and baby boomers (13%). Moreover, the credit card rewards market is richer than ever. Credit card aficionados are able to use points and miles earned through credit card to earn free vacations, flights and hotel stays. However, with multiple offers on the market, across many major credit card issuers, comparing options can be a daunting task for many. Furthermore, choosing the wrong rewards credit card can leave thousands of dollars on the table in un-optimized rewards.

# Goal

To develop a tool that will allow users to easily compare different rewards credit cards based on how they shop. Allow even a novice credit card user to get a card that will allow him or her to earn the most points, miles or cash back they can.

# Product

We’ll develop a credit card comparison tool that accounts for peoples’ spending habits, and instantly ranks credit card options from America’s top 6 banks - from most to least rewarding. The tool will also display to users their first year rewards value estimate, and provide a few details about each card so they can quickly compare cards side-by-side.


We can collect information on credit cards from here: https://www.creditcards.com/rewards-cards/

Cash back is easy, because that’s just straight money (example 1% cash back on $100 is just $1)
